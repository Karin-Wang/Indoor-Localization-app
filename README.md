# Indoor-Localization-app

An Wifi siganl strength(RSSI level) based Bayesian indoor localization Android app for indoor localization on 3rd and 4th floor of building 28 in TU Delft.

There are 19 cells in all these two floors. The online test result has the accuracy around 0.7.

## Special feature
We use different radio maps for bayesian filtering based on different directions(North, South, West and East). This is for the reason that the body effect influnece the strength of the wifi signal strength from the same AP a lot.
